# SWN Foundation GPT Prompts

**_DISCLAIMER_**: If you are one of the players in my group, please understand that clues and plot points for your game lie below. Please turn back now!

**Context**: I am running a game of Stars Without Number set in the Isaac Asimov Foundation universe and utilizing ChatGPT to help build the universe in an "accurate" manner as quickly as possible.

## Foreword 

ChatGPT has some practical limitations that one must always keep in mind for use as a GM assistant. 

1. Know your model token length limits. 

For ChatGPT, provided they use the same API they make public, it would be 20,000 tokens for GPT-4, and 2,000 for ChatGPT/GPT-3.5-Turbo. Tokens can be thought of as similar to syllabals, a sort of fundemental breakdown of speech sounds into parts. This explains how ChatGPT can respond to sometimes incoherrent input with remarkable accuracy. 

2. Know the model's training limitations.

In my case, Stars Without Number seems to be remarkably well understood. This can be explained by the fact that the Free PDF can be found online and scraped without any effort. Additionally, excerpts, discussions of and about, and extended fiction exists for Isaac Asimov's Foundation that can be found online. For my particular use-case, ChatGPT is ideal. For other systems or settings, this can change drastically. 

3. Know the web-app's limitations

The web app doesn't allow me to configure "system" messages like I can with the API. So it's important to get a feeling for when 20,000 tokens is reached and start a new chat with a summarized context.
With the API, this limitation can be avoided by updating the "system" message with summarized/compressed data that would've normally "fallen off" by now.

I am running a Table Top RPG game in the Stars Without Number system, in the Isaac Asimov's Foundation universe. Particularly set before the events of the "First Crisis" between the newly created independent Kingdom of Anacreon and the fledgling colony on Terminus. Salvor Hardin is mayor of Terminus at this time, and tensions in the periphery are at an all-time-high. 

The players are a motley crew that include: 
* a savvy, space-dwarf-esque trader named Kostean, 
* a talented and young Expert Physician with sharp features named Doc Percy, 
* a soldier turned diplomat named Martev, 
* a mysterious female Expert Pilot named Lucy who's usually obscured under a Ushanka, dark goggles, and thick, bundled scarf, 
* and a former criminal with psychic teleportation powers named Simon who also happens to be a secret spy for the Second Foundation. 

The party is currently on a space station called Anacreon Orbital IV which orbits around Paris, the furthest planet in orbit around both Anacreon A and Anacreon B. The planet is an airless, life-less and barren. However, due to geothermal power, vast domes were constructed on it that enclose parks and Royal campuses for low-g events, sports, and luxury. 

At present, King Leopold of Anacreon is holding the Micro-gravity games, an olympics-like series of games with the common theme of low-gravity. Because of this, Anacreon Orbital IV, usually a relative backwater used for free-trade is bustling with activity, heightened security, and incredible wealth. 

At the same time, there is a brewing crisis, because of a lack of fissile material for their reactors the Space Station is about to lose power. Currently they are running with less power to radiation shielding and other key employee-safetey measures to hide the fact that there's an emergency. The party has been selected by the Station's Commander to find the wreckage of the pirate ship who stole the shipment in an asteroid field, but was promptly shot down. Alternatively they can source their own fissile materials as a replacement. They will be rewarded immensely for doing this AND keeping it quiet so not to cause panic on the station. 

I need to figure out the following things for the next session.
